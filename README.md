The Use Case
~~~
 â€” 10/09/2024 11:20 PM
Zero-Knowledge Merging (ZKM) can be applied in the context of secure cross-chain asset transfers in decentralized finance (DeFi), drawing inspiration from Entangled Rollup and Hybrid Rollup technologies.

Problem
In DeFi, transferring assets between different blockchains poses security, scalability, and privacy challenges. The current systems either expose transaction details (reducing privacy) or have to rely on centralized intermediaries (which introduce trust issues). Additionally, as blockchains grow, scalability issues arise, making on-chain data validation more complex and expensive.
Privacy-Preserving Transfers: Users initiate asset transfers on Chain A, but the transaction data remains private. Only a ZKP confirming the correctness of the transfer is submitted to Chain B. This ensures that the validity of the transaction is proven without revealing sensitive details like sender, recipient, or asset amounts.

Cross-Chain Settlement: The ZKM rollup maintains synchronized state on both chains using ZKPs to prove that the asset transfer has been processed correctly on Chain A before it is finalized on Chain B. The entanglement of the states ensures that both chains agree on the current state without needing to verify the actual data on-chain, reducing gas fees and improving scalability.

Efficiency and Scalability: By utilizing off-chain computation and proof aggregation, the ZKM rollup only submits minimal data to the main chain. This hybrid approach between on-chain finality and off-chain data availability improves throughput and reduces costs.

Conclusion
This use case leverages ZKM to facilitate secure, efficient, and private asset transfers across multiple blockchains. It combines the privacy benefits of Zero-Knowledge Proofs with the scalability and interoperability advantages of Entangled and Hybrid Rollups. This ensures that users can move assets securely while keeping transaction data private, all without compromising on-chain security or trustlessness.
